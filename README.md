# üß† Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Detection Using Machine Learning

This project explores the detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) through machine learning models applied to both behavioral questionnaire data and neuroimaging (fMRI) data from the ABIDE dataset. It aims to demonstrate the potential of AI-driven tools in supporting early and accurate ASD diagnosis using multimodal data.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `models on the questionnaire dataset/`: ML models applied to structured questionnaire data (CSV format)
- `models on the ABIDE dataset/`: Feature extraction and classification on ABIDE fMRI data using Nilearn
- `datasets/`: datasets used

## üîç Objective

To compare the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms on:
- Questionnaire-based structured data
- Preprocessed ABIDE neuroimaging data

and to evaluate their potential for real-world clinical support in ASD diagnosis.
